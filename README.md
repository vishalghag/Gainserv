## Task: Build a User Management Application

## Description:
You are tasked with building a user management application using ReactJS, Redux, and Material UI. The application should allow users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user data.

## Requirements:
1. The application should have a responsive layout using Material UI components.
2. Implement a form to add new users. The form should include fields for name, email, and role.
3. Display a list of all users fetched from the localstorage. Each user should be displayed in a table-like format, showing their name, email, and role.
4. Provide functionality to edit and delete individual users.
5. Implement client-side form validation for the user input fields.
6. Utilize Redux for state management, including actions and reducers for fetching users, adding a user, editing a user, and deleting a user.
7. Use Redux Toolkit to simplify the Redux setup and logic.
8. Implement error handling and display appropriate messages in case of any failures or invalid user inputs.
9. Implement pagination or infinite scrolling for the user list.
10. Add sorting and filtering options for the user list.

Bonus Points (Optional):
- Any new feature which you can add by applying your own creativity.
- Implement unit tests for Redux actions and reducers using a testing library like Jest.

Guidelines:
1. Use ReactJS and Material UI components for building the user interface.
2. You can use any preferred JavaScript features and ES6+ syntax.
3. Use Redux and Redux Toolkit for state management.
4. You may use any additional libraries or tools from the mentioned skill set if necessary.
